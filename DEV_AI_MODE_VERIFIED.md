# ✅ Dev:AI Mode - Fully Functional and Verified

## Summary

The `npm run dev:ai` command has been **successfully fixed and tested**. It now allows AI assistants (like Cursor) to access the admin UI without needing to authenticate via GitHub OAuth.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Worker Configuration** (`worker/.dev.vars`)
Created a `.dev.vars` file with proper environment variables:
```env
AUTH_DISABLED=true
SESSION_ALLOW_INSECURE_COOKIES=true
JWT_SECRET=dev-local
```

### 2. **Package.json Script** (`worker/package.json`)
Simplified the `dev:ai` script to use `.dev.vars`:
```json
"dev:ai": "wrangler dev --port 8787"
```
(Wrangler automatically reads `.dev.vars` when running in dev mode)

### 3. **Root Package.json** (`package.json`)
The main `dev:ai` command properly passes environment variables to the admin:
```json
"dev:ai": "concurrently \"npm -w worker run dev:ai\" \"VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8787 VITE_AUTH_DISABLED=true npm -w admin run dev\""
```

## How It Works

### Dual Authentication Bypass

The system provides **two independent** authentication bypass mechanisms:

1. **`x-dev-auth` Header (localhost-only)**
   - Admin UI sends `x-dev-auth: 1` header on all API requests
   - Worker accepts this header ONLY from localhost/127.0.0.1
   - Works even if `AUTH_DISABLED` is false
   - Safety: Production ignores this header (not localhost)

2. **`AUTH_DISABLED` Environment Variable**
   - Set to `true` in `.dev.vars`
   - Worker returns mock user for ALL requests
   - No authentication required at all
   - Completely bypasses OAuth flow

## Test Results

### ✅ API Tests (curl)

**Test 1: Authentication with header**
```bash
curl -H "x-dev-auth: 1" http://localhost:8787/api/user
```
**Result**: Returns mock user `ai-dev` ✓

**Test 2: Authentication without header (AUTH_DISABLED mode)**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/user
```
**Result**: Returns mock user `ai-dev` ✓

**Test 3: Protected endpoint (create link)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/links \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-dev-auth: 1" \
  -d '{"shortcode":"test","url":"https://example.com"}'
```
**Result**: Link created successfully ✓

**Test 4: Redirect**
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8787/test
```
**Result**: 301 redirect to https://example.com ✓

### ✅ Admin UI Tests (Browser)

**UI Features Verified:**
- ✅ **"Auth disabled (dev)" badge** displayed in header
- ✅ **"Welcome, ai-dev!"** greeting shown
- ✅ **No login screen** - bypassed OAuth completely
- ✅ **Create Link modal** opens and works
- ✅ **Form validation** working correctly
- ✅ **Mock user avatar** displaying
- ✅ **All tabs accessible** (Links, Analytics)

## Usage Instructions

### Starting Dev:AI Mode

```bash
npm run dev:ai
```

This starts:
- **Worker** on `http://localhost:8787` (with AUTH_DISABLED=true)
- **Admin UI** on `http://localhost:5173/admin/` (with VITE_AUTH_DISABLED=true)

### What You'll See

1. **No Login Screen**: Admin UI loads directly to dashboard
2. **Dev Badge**: Header shows "Auth disabled (dev)" badge
3. **Mock User**: Logged in as "AI Developer" (ai-dev)
4. **Full Access**: Can create, edit, delete links and view analytics

### For AI Assistants

When running `npm run dev:ai`, you can:
- ✅ Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/admin/`
- ✅ Access all features without authentication
- ✅ Create and manage links programmatically
- ✅ Test UI interactions in the browser
- ✅ Verify API endpoints work correctly

## Security

### Safety Mechanisms

1. **`.dev.vars` is gitignored**: Won't be committed to repository
2. **localhost-only header**: `x-dev-auth` only works on 127.0.0.1/localhost
3. **Production unaffected**: `AUTH_DISABLED` is NOT set in production
4. **Clear indication**: UI shows "Auth disabled (dev)" badge

### Production vs Dev

| Feature | Production | Dev:AI Mode |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| OAuth | Required ✓ | Bypassed ✓ |
| Session Cookies | Secure, HttpOnly | Insecure (local) |
| Auth Header | Ignored | Accepted (localhost) |
| Mock User | Never | Always |
| UI Badge | None | "Auth disabled (dev)" |

## Files Modified

1. **`worker/.dev.vars`** - NEW: Development environment variables
2. **`worker/package.json`** - MODIFIED: Simplified `dev:ai` script  
3. **`package.json`** - UNMODIFIED: Already had correct setup

## Troubleshooting

### If auth doesn't work:

1. **Check servers are running**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8787 -i :5173
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables** are loaded:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8787/api/user
   # Should return mock user without any headers
   ```

3. **Restart if needed**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "wrangler dev" && pkill -f "vite"
   npm run dev:ai
   ```

## Next Steps

The dev:ai mode is now **production-ready** for AI-assisted development!  
You can safely use this mode for local development and testing.
